# Codex-Ledger

***Codex-Ledger*** bridges the gap between rapid AI iteration and rigorous engineering standards by treating your AI agent as a first-class collaborator, not just a script. It intercepts every LLM request and execution trace, automatically organizing AI-driven coding sessions into a structured Git history on dedicated AI branches. Each change is committed with autogenerated PR notes, architectural rationale, and execution logs, enabling human reviewers to audit the agent’s reasoning and evolution as transparently as a senior developer’s pull request.
