# Codex-Legder

***Codex-Legder*** bridges the gap between rapid AI iteration and rigorous engineering standards by treating your AI agent as a first-class collaborator, not just a script. By intercepting every LLM request and execution trace, it automatically organizes "vibecoding" sessions into a structured Git history on dedicated AI branches. Each change is accompanied by autogenerated PR notes, architectural rationale, and execution logs, allowing human reviewers to audit the agent’s "thought process" as easily as they would a senior developer's pull request
